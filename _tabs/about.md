Hello, my name is Ian Eusebio and I am a Computer Information Systems student at Cal Poly Pomona. I'm planning on using this blog to document my IT projects, practice writing, and enjoy the process along the way. Technology has always been a meaningful way for me to help others, and I hope to strengthen that skill here.

In my free time, I like swimming, drawing, visiting museums, and doing community service. Feel free to connect with me:
