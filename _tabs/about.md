Hello, my name is Ian Eusebio and I am a Computer Information Systems student at Cal Poly Pomona. I'm planning on using this blog to document my IT / cybersecurity projects, practice writing, and enjoy the process along the way. Technology has always been a meaningful way for me to help others, so I hope to strengthen that skill here.

In my free time, I like swimming, drawing, gaming, visiting museums, and doing community service. Feel free to connect with me:
