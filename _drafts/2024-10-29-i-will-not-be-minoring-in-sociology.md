I scheduled an appointment with my career counselor. She gave me some good resources and advice on whether or not I should minor in Sociology.

She says that she knew an alumni with my major who used to tutor people (mainly elderly folks) on how to use technology, and now they work with teachers on implementing some type of educational technology. I thought that was really cool and I’d like to do something like that, but she said that that alumni didn’t have a sociology background or necessarily need it. But if I were to do it, it wouldn’t necessarily hurt me. And I could just minor in it if I really enjoy it.

Pros:

* Very interesting to me. I like how there’s a lot of overlap with psychology and how it focuses on larger scale societal issues.
* It could possibly allow me to pivot if I ever wanted to switch careers. The coursework gives the basics of sociology if I ever wanted to get an MSW or something.
* It’s something I care about. I’m of the opinion that if we better understand the underlying root of social issues, then we can change them. When you know better, you do better, like Maya Angelou said.
* Would connect me more with like-minded people
* Would be an interesting complement to my major in computer information systems. * The overlap between technology and sociology is really cool, like using computers for some type of social good.

Cons

* Like Cherrie said, I don’t necessarily have to minor in sociology to do something good with computers.
* It would take an extra year since it’d be another 24 units.
* It would put me in more debt. These are smaller considerations because if I do feel like I need an extra year and want to take that on, then it could be worth it, but it’s still a barrier to spend more time and money.
* I might not enjoy it. Learning about sociology on my own vs having to study it in an academic setting are 2 different things. It could end up killing my enjoyment for the subject.
* I could also get burnt out if I were to take another year.
* It probably won’t be directly beneficial to me career-wise.
* Added stress: It would be another thing to have on my plate.
* There’s also only a few classes I really want to take: the basic counseling skills courses, social stratification class, multicultural psychology, and the basic principles of sociology class. I can look into taking or auditing those courses without adding them as a full on minor.

Ultimately, I don’t think it’s worth it, as much as it pains me to say it. It’s not required for what I want to do. Not that it has to be, but if I were to take on a whole extra year and a minor, I’d need it to be something that I was fully into. But I still have some doubts about it.

I think the best thing to do is to audit the sociology courses I like and then go from there. If I end up loving them, I’ll consider doing the minor, but if I end up enjoying them but not totally into it, I’ll just stick with auditing it.

It would be taking too much on for something that would only have a marginal benefit to me. Right now, I think the feeling is more of, “Oh this would be really fun. I really like this subject and care about it,” but it’s not, “I am deeply passionate about it. Enough that I want to major in it.”

Also, if I end up not minoring in Sociology, I think I’d be ok with it. I don’t think I’d regret it. If I was like, “I need to at least minor in this or I’ll regret it.” Then I’d be more inclined to add the minor. And who knows? Maybe I’ll get that feeling once I audit classes. But for now, I’m ok.
